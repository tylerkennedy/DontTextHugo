## General

### How can I contact you?

[Visit the contact page](/contact)

### Do you have an android app?

Dont Text is only available for iOS devices at this time.

### Can the app block texts on Mac computers?

Unfortunately, Dont Text can not filter texts on Mac. This is a commonly requested feature, but Apple does not allow developers to build spam text filtering apps for Mac, so Dont Text only works on iOS devices (iPhone and iPad).

### How do I enable text message filtering?

1.  Download [Dont Text from the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dont-text/id1540836811)
2.  Go to the settings app on your device
    * (iOS 18 and later only) Go to Apps inside the Settings app
3.  Scroll down and tap on ‘Messages’
4.  Scroll down and tap on ‘Unknown & Spam’
5.  Toggle to enable ‘Filter Unknown Senders' and select Dont Text

### I'm still getting spam texts. Why isn't the app working?

If you are still getting spam texts after downloading Dont Text, there are a couple things to check for.

1. Make sure you followed the steps [above](#how-do-i-enable-text-message-filtering) to enable text filtering. Dont Text can only filter spam if you've given the app permission to filter texts.

2. Check that you have added keywords with the 'block' setting inside the app or upgraded to Worry Free Filtering.

3. Check that you do not have keywords with the 'allow' setting allowing texts to pass through the filter. 'Allow' keywords have priority over 'block' keywords and will not block the text if they are both in the text message body.

4. Dont Text can only filter green SMS text messages. If spam texts are coming from blue iMessage addresses or numbers, they cannot be filtered.

5. Worry Free Filtering requires an internet connection to block texts. Make sure you are connected to WiFi or a data plan at the moment you receive the texts so Dont Text can filtering them.


### What's the difference between 'block' and 'allow' keywords?

Keywords with the 'block' setting are sent to Junk. Keywords with the 'allow' setting will pass through the filter even if it contains a different blocking keyword. If there is a conflict between a 'block' and 'allow' keyword that are contained in the same message, the message will be allowed through the filter.

### Why are texts getting blocked that shouldn't?

Check that you do not have keywords set that could be blocking the wrong messages on accident. If you frequently receive texts from the same unknown number that you do not want to be blocked, consider adding that number to your contacts. Finally, use keywords with the 'allow' setting to prevent certain texts from being blocked. This is useful for verification codes or other text notifications that you might get often from numbers not in your contacts.

### What happens to blocked texts?

Blocked texts are sent the the Junk folder in the Messages app on your iPhone. You can still view blocked messages there.


### Does the messages app still work?

Yes all your text messages still appear in the messages app. Dont Text is **not** a messenger app.

### How do I delete a keyword?

To delete a keyword from the block list, swipe the row of the keyword by dragging to the left. The red delete button will appear, press it.
