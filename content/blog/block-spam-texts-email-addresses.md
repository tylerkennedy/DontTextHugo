## Why Do Spam Texts Come from an Email Address?

Many spammers use an email address to send spam texts instead of a phone number for several reasons. First, it is easier to get an email address than a phone number. You can create an email address for free on tons of sites. You can also create an email anonymously without needing to put in any personal info.

A phone number on the other hand costs money to register and requires a good deal of personal information to setup.

Another reason spammers like email is that they can send spam texts for free. SMS or Short Message Service, usually charges per text sent.

Spammers are in this for the money so, they are always looking for a low cost method. They use email addresses to send texts because it is cheaper than SMS.
