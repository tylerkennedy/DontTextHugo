Usually, attackers include a link in their spam texts that lead to a dangerous website. Opening the linked webpage can result in having your passwords stolen or receiving even more spam texts (no body wants that!)

After getting a spam text, you might have opened the link by accident. Or maybe you were curious and decided to click the link. In either scenario, if you are worried that the text is spam and the link was unsafe, here is what you can do to protect yourself.

## Close the Webpage Right Away

The first thing to do if you accidentally click on a link from a spam text is to close the webpage. This basic step protects you from the link doing any further damage. Or you accidentally clicking something else.

Next time, avoid clicking on links in any unwanted text messages. You should not use the link preview feature either to peek at the link. Do not open links from texts you were not expecting to receive.

It is also a good idea to go ahead and delete the text message with the link. Deleting the message prevents you from accidentally clicking on the link again.

## Never Enter Passwords or Personal Information

Never directly enter your password into a webpage that you opened from a link. You cannot be 100% certain that this website is legitimate. The fake website might be trying to trick you into giving them your password.

Instead, go to the website through your browser without copying and pasting the link. Use Google or the webpage address to reach the official site. This prevents you from accidentally entering your password onto the wrong website that will steal it. 

[Spotting phishing links](/blog/7-ways-to-spot-phishing-emails) is hard. If you were lucky enough to realize the link was spam before you entered any information, good job! You can skip the next section.

### Reset Your Password

Unfortunately, if you did not realize the link was spam until it is too late, you will need to take some additional steps. 

If you think your password was stolen, the first thing to do is reset your password. This prevents the attacker from using the password they stole and protects your account.

In the event you entered your credit card or financial information on a spam website. Contact your bank or financial institution to secure your account.

## Update Your Phoneâ€™s Operating System

Closing the linked webpage does not guarantee 100% safety from a spam text. While more rare, some websites contain viruses or malware.

It is hard to tell if a website contained malware without further investigation. However, one of the best protective measures is keeping your phone's operating system up to date. 

Operating system updates are important for protecting your phone against known threats. OS updates patch vulnerabilities in your phone's software that attackers can exploit. Make sure to regularly check for updates and install them immediately.
