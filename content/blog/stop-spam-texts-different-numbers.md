What is worse than one spam text? Hundreds of them. A phone full of unwanted text messages, from different numbers is enough to drive you crazy.

It feels almost impossible to block them all. Going in to each message and blocking the sender one-by-one just gets tiring. Thankfully, there is an easy way to block spam texts that come from different phone numbers or email addresses.

## Block All Unknown Senders

iOS includes a [built-in setting](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/block-filter-and-report-messages-iph203ab0be4/ios) that makes blocking spam texts really easy, even if they come from different numbers. Enabling this setting turns off notifications from all senders **not** saved in your contacts. You no longer have to worry about blocking each number that sends you spam text messages. 

### Here's how you do it:

1. Go to settings on your iPhone
2. Scroll down and tap on ‘Messages’
3. Scroll down and tap on ‘Unknown & Spam’
4. Enable ‘Filter Unknown Senders’

The only downside of this setting is that **all** messages from unknown senders will get blocked. Sometimes you will filter the wrong messages on accident. Maybe you get automated texts from different stores or restaurants you wouldn't want to block. The only way to ensure they go unblocked is to save those numbers to your contacts.
