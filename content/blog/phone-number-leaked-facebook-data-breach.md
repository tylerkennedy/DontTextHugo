Facebook is at the forefront of yet another privacy nightmare. In early April, it was discovered that over 500 million phone numbers and emails were leaked in the most recent Facebook data breach. Half a billion people now have their personal information exposed online. The data in the leak includes names, phone numbers, email addresses, passwords, birth dates, and locations.
 
With all of this data exposed on the internet, there is little that can be done to reverse the affects. 

Cyber criminals will have a field day with the information from the breach. Victims can expect increasing volumes of spam texts, scam calls, and [phishing emails](/blog/what-is-phishing). 

## How to Check If I Was in the Facebook Data Breach?

It is really simple to check if you were involved in this breach. The data that is being used by cyber criminals for illegal online activities is also available to security researchers. Thanks to researchers' effort, the leaked data is available for the public to check if they were involved in the breach.

[Troy Hunt](https://www.troyhunt.com/), a respected security expert, runs [HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) so that anyone can check if they were in a data breach. 

To see if you were a part of the Facebook leak, go to HaveIBeenPwned and enter your email or phone number.

## What Should I Do If My Data Was Exposed?

If you found that you were a part of the breach you are probably wondering what you should do next. Fortunately, there are a couple easy things you can do to protect yourself. 

### Change Your Password

This data breach included passwords. If you were involved, you need to change your password for your Facebook account and any other accounts that use that password. As a good rule of thumb, never reuse passwords between multiple accounts. If the password of one account is leaked, all of your accounts could be accessed.
