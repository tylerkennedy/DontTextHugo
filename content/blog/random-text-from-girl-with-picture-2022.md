Often, the message contains no additional text, but people later get a follow up text apologizing for texting the wrong number. The original sender then compliments them on being so nice for not responding rudely, and asks if they still want to chat.

From there, the original sender tries to get a conversation going with the person who received the text. 

If you are getting the type of text messages described above, you are being targeted by [romance scams](https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes/romance-scams).


## What Is a Romance Scam?

Romance scams are a type of online scam that target victims by trying create a relationship or connection with the victim. Organizers of these scams often try to use pictures of attractive women to lure victims into the scam. 

Another way the senders make these scams look more real is by using local area codes. Across the country, from [San Diego](https://www.10news.com/news/team-10/romance-scam-features-text-messages-and-picture-of-random-woman) to [Indianapolis](https://fox59.com/investigations/warning-issued-after-womans-picture-used-for-possible-scam/), people are getting these text messages from their local area codes. 

This is to make the texts seem more real and make people more likely to respond. Sometimes the scam will even ask victims to meetup in person.

The end goal of these scams is to get personal information or money from victims. 

## Is It Safe To Respond to These Texts?

[Responding to text messages from strangers](/blog/i-replied-to-a-spam-text/) is **never** a good idea. 

When you respond to these texts, you let the sender know that your phone number is active and they will keep sending you more messages. 

Another reason not to respond is to protect yourself from being scammed.

Scams like this try to build a connection with victims and manipulate them in order to get money from the victims. After chatting with the intended victim for a while, the scammer will ask them to send money or buy gift cards or sign up and pay for accounts online for them. 

Another angle that these scams take is sending dirty or inappropriate messages hoping to get the same kind of response back, including pictures. 

The scammers then use these messages to blackmail the victim, threatening to share the texts online or with family or an employer if the victim does not pay.

The best way to prevent any of this from happening to you, is by not responding and deleting the texts immediately.
