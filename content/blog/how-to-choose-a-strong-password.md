When choosing a new password there are two things to keep in mind. Length and abstraction. This is how you should describe all of your passwords. It is important to choose a strong password for all of your online accounts. A strong password is the first step to securing your account. Attackers will try to gain access to your account by brute-force guessing as many passwords as possible. Computers can guess millions of password in a second. Gone are the days of basic passwords. Faster computing power and hacking tools can easily guess simple, one-word passwords. These types of attacks make strong passwords important for securing your account. To create a strong password, you need to understand what makes a password strong.

## DNA of Strong Passwords

There are a few indicators of strong passwords. A strong password is long, complex, avoids common patterns, and is free from personal info. Let's look at the makeup of a secure password.

### Length

The most important factor when choosing a password is length. Longer passwords are more secure because length makes them harder to crack. Let's do some math real quick. We will assume a password consists of any of the 95 characters available on an English keyboard. A password that is 1 character in length will take 95 attempts to guess randomly. An 8 character password will take 958 attempts by guessing at random. A 16 character password will take 9516 attempts, that's 6,634,204,312,890,625 times more than an 8 character password. Hopefully, these calculations give you a clearer understanding of the importance of length in a password. Every character added to a password increases the time needed to crack the password exponentially. The longer it takes to guess a password, the more secure it is. Adding length to your passwords is the easiest way to make them stronger.

There is no magic number when it comes to the length of your password. If you had to pick a minimum length, 16 characters is a good starting point. However, choose a password that is as long as you can remember. 16 is not a maximum, always try to choose a longer password. If you can handle more than 16 characters, do that. As a guide, when you create a password, try to fill up the width of the login form. When I am creating a new password, I am satisfied that my password is long enough if I fill up the form. Following this trick will give you better and longer passwords than most internet users. Later, I will share a tip for creating and remembering long passwords.

### Complexity

Complexity is the next most important factor when choosing a strong password. When creating a strong password, it is important to use a variety of letters, numbers, and special symbols. Varying character types increases the complexity of your password. Using both upper and lower case letters increases the number of available characters from 26 to 52. This doubles the complexity of your passwords. Using the digits 0-9 adds another 10 available characters to your password. Finally, specials symbols like !@#$%&()? add even more possibilities to password combinations. The point of creating complex passwords is to increase the number of possible combinations that could be your password. This makes your password stronger because an attacker has to guess more possible passwords until they find yours.

### Avoid Common Patterns

The most common pattern for a password is an upper case letter followed by lowercase letters and a number or symbol at the end. It may looks something like this, '_Password!_'. Using special symbols in your passwords can be tricky. The most common way to use them is replacing letters like 's' with '$' or 'a' with '@'. Another common use is simply placing '!' at the end of each password to meet password requirements.

Using special symbols in this way is not bad, but it is not as helpful as you might think. Attackers account for the common use of symbols and upper case letters in their password guessing algorithms. This means that the best way to use symbols and upper case letters is by using them in a non-conventional way. Avoid using only one capital letter at the start of your password or one symbol at the end. Again, it is not bad to use them in this way. However, placing multiple throughout your password and breaking the conventional pattern makes your passwords more complex and secure.

### No Personal Information

Personal info should never be used in a password. Your birthday, family's names, favorite sports team, pet's name, address, phone number and other info could be found online. In fact, most of that information is easy to find on your social media profiles. Attackers know that people like to use personal info in passwords. Attackers use special programs that can generate possible passwords based off of personal information they gather. First they browse a target's social media profile to collect info. Then, the info is fed into a program to create possible passwords for the target. Using information about you that is freely available online in your passwords is not safe. To create stronger passwords, stay away from using your personal info.

### Unique to Each Account

Every account that you use should have it's own password. This makes all of your accounts more secure. It is essential to use different passwords because this helps isolate each account. If one account is compromised, has the password stolen, or leaked, all of your other accounts will remain safe. However, if all of your accounts used the same password, only one account would need to be compromised for an attacker to gain access to them all.

## How to Craft Strong Passwords

Now that we have reviewed what makes up strong passwords, it is time to create your own. I will share two methods that I use for creating strong and secure passwords.

### Use a Sentence

Creating strong passwords from scratch can be hard. You might not be sure where to start. When I create a new password from scratch I start with a sentence. The first step is to create a sentence in your head or open a book and find one you want to use. Then choose two words in the sentence to capitalize. Finally add in a couple numbers and symbols.

Here is an example of this technique. First, I chose the sentence 'light bulbs are hot'. Next, I choose two words to capitalize: 'light BULBS are HOT'. Finally, I add in a couple of numbers and symbols at random: 'light! BULBS are 2HOT'. This password is long compared to most users' passwords at 21 characters. It is complex by using a variety of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. It contains no personal information and I will only use this for one account. The sentence format makes this password easier to remember than something completely random. After typing this password in a couple times you'll have no problem recalling it from muscle memory.

### Password Generators

A password generator makes creating new passwords easy. In a couple clicks, you can have a strong password made for you to use with any account. There are lots of free password generators available online. To find one, search 'password generator' and that should get you started. I personally recommend using [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/password-generator). Their password generator allows you to choose the length of your password and options to include upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. They even offer more advanced options like easy to read or say passwords.

## Always Use Strong Passwords

Following the steps in this post for creating stronger passwords will make your accounts safer. Stronger passwords keep your accounts safe by making your password harder to guess. Using unique passwords also stops password reuse and protects all your accounts. Continue to follow these steps with every password you create to improve your online security practices.
