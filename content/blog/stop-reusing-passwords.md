Reusing passwords is an easy habit to develop. You don't have to memorize a ton of different passwords. You never have to worry about forgetting your password or where you wrote it down. All of your accounts are easy to log into because they have the same password. Why would you want to make things complicated by using more than one password?

It is a lot easier to use the same password for every account rather than a unique password for each one. Most people easily have over 50 accounts. How are you supposed to memorize a password for each one? When you are signing up for a new account you are in a hurry and just want to start using the website. You are not concerned about account security when you sign up for the service. Your focus is logging in and using your account, not choosing a good password. So what do you do? You use the same password that you use for all of your accounts.

Make no mistake, reusing passwords is a dangerous habit. While it is the easy choice, it is not the safe choice. Most often in security, convenience is the opposite of security. Using the same password because it is convenient is not a good security practice. Reusing passwords can compromise all of your accounts. Reusing passwords makes the fallout of a phishing attack, data breach, or any type of security incident more impactful. Using the same password for every account will destroy just about every security measure you have in place.

## Phishers Love When People are Reusing Passwords

A single [phishing](https://tkdata.io/what-is-phishing/) attack can have harmful effects on accounts that use the same password. Phishing attacks use fake emails and websites to steal your passwords. Phishing usually looks like an email from a company asking you to log into your account for security purposes. The link in the email will take you to a fake page that looks like a real login page. After entering your email and password to login, the webpage steals your password. Attackers now have access to the account and your password. However, all other accounts that use the same password are in danger.

When attackers steal your password through phishing, they don't stop at just that one account. In fact, phishers will try to get control of as many of your accounts as possible. Attackers use your email and password to try to log into popular services that you likely use. They only need to phish one of your accounts to gain access to all of them. Automated tools plug in your stolen password to gain access to your accounts. This means any other account with the same password is in danger. While only one of your accounts was phished, all of them are vulnerable if they use the same password. Phishing attacks affect people that reuse passwords harder than people who use different passwords. Protect yourself by using different passwords for each login.

## Data Breaches Jeopardize Your Accounts

Your password being stolen is not always your fault. You entrust companies to keep your data safe and store your passwords securely. Companies get lazy, have poor security, and make mistakes, then your personal info and passwords leak. When data breaches occur, users are the main victims. User's passwords get published online and must face attacks on their accounts.

In the same way as phishing, people that reuse passwords are hit harder by data breaches. When your email and password are in a data breach, attackers try to log into your other accounts. They try logging into popular services with your email and password. Their hope is that you are using the same password and they get access. You can check to see if your accounts are in a data breach. Visit [have i been pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) to see if your accounts are a part of a data breach.

## Stop Reusing Passwords and Use a Password Manager

Start using different passwords to up your online security. This is a basic step that everyone can take. Password managers are an easy way to take this step. A password manager creates and stores all of your passwords. When you login, the password manager auto pastes in your login info. You do not have to worry about knowing or writing down passwords. All you need is one main password to access all of your passwords. There are lots of password managers available online. There are both free and paid options to choose from out there. Many password managers offer browser plugins, mobile, and desktop apps to fit your needs. Choose the platform that works for you.

## Sleep Better By Using Unique Passwords

Reusing passwords is a hard habit to break. However, no longer reusing passwords will protect your accounts better than before. You can sleep better at night knowing one data breach won't lose all of your accounts. A unique password for each account is the best way to protect yourself from phishing attacks and data breaches. Avoid reusing passwords at all costs. The easiest way to do this is by using a password manager and different passwords for each account.
