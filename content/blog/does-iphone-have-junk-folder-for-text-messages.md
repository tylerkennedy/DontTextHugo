If you use email then you are already familar with how spam and junk folders work. Whenever you receive an unwanted spam email, your inbox automatically moves the junk mail straight to the junk folder. 

When your inbox misses a junk email and fails to move it to the junk folder automatically, you can mark the email as spam yourself and move it to the junk folder. Over time, your inbox will get smarter and keep sorting more of the junk mail into the junk folder. 

How awesome would it be if your iPhone also had a junk folder just like your email inbox?

For years, users have wanted the same junk folder functionality for text messages on their iPhone. Fortunately, there is good news. Now you can [enable a junk folder](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/block-filter-and-report-messages-iph203ab0be4/ios) for your messages on iPhone.

When you enable the text message filtering on your iPhone, you will notice that your messages app looks different. There are several folders in the messages app that can sort your incoming text messages. 

### Known and Unknown Senders 🤨

The first section of message folders consists of texts from known and unknown senders. An unknown sender is a phone number or email address that is not saved in your phone's contacts. 

The All Messages folder contains all of your text messages that are unorganized and unfiltered. This folder is the default folder that you are used to using if you never enable message filtering.

The Known Senders and Unknown Senders folders allow you to sort your text messages by if you know the text message sender or not. You can always use the  All Messages folder to see texts from both known and unknown phone numbers. 

### Transactions and Promotions 📢

The Transcations and Promotions folder can be used to sort out automated text messages that you receive. 

The Transactions folder is used to filtering texts for online receipts. The Promotions folder is used to sort out marketing text messages from advertisers. 

### Junk 🗑

The junk folder is by far the most useful filter on iPhone. This folder is where all spam and junk text messages are sent. 

When you get a text message from an unknown sender that is marked as junk, you will not get a pop up notification and the text is silently moved to the junk folder. This way you are not bothered when you receive a spam text message.
