Every election cycle the number of unwanted spam texts only seems to increase. Political campaigns now send text messages to extend their outreach. Political texts are used to register new voters, gather support for candidates, and raise funds for political campaigns. 

For people who did not sign up to receive these texts, or no longer want to receive them, political texts can be very annoying. The good news is that it is really easy to stop political texts and get rid of them from your phone.

# Reply STOP to Unsubscribe

Most political texts are sent by automated text message services. Usually these services give you the option to unsubscribe or opt-out of the message campaign. Most of the time, all you have to do is text back STOP or CANCEL.

9/10 times you will get one last text from the sender telling you that you've successfully unsubscribed and will no longer get their texts. If this is the case, congrats you are done. 

Another scenario might be the reply says you need to text something other than STOP to unsubscribe. If this is the case, follow their instructions to unsubscribe.

This is a little known secret that marketers and campaigners do not want you to know about. Most people do not how easy it is to get rid of spam texts.

Sometimes you will not get a text back that you have unsubscribed or you keep getting the texts anyway. If this happens, you need to block the texts instead.
