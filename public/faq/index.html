Download Dont Text from the App Store Go to settings Scroll down and tap on Messages Scroll down and tap on Spam \u0026 Filtering Select Dont Text to allow our app to filter your messages  I’m still getting spam texts. Why isn’t the app working? Make sure you followed the steps above to enable text filtering. Next, check that you have added keywords with the ‘block’ setting inside the Dont Text app. Texts will only be blocked if they are from a sender not saved in your contacts and they contain a keyword with the ‘block’ setting. If a message contains a keyword with the ‘allow’ setting, it will not be blocked.\nWhat’s the difference between ‘block’ and ‘allow’ keywords? Keywords with the ‘block’ setting are sent to Junk. Keywords with the ‘allow’ setting will pass through the filter even if it contains a different blocking keyword. If there is a conflict between a ‘block’ and ‘allow’ keyword that are contained in the same message, the message will be allowed through the filter.\nWhy are texts getting blocked that shouldn’t? Check that you do not have keywords set that could be blocking the wrong messages on accident. If you frequently receive texts from the same unknown number that you do not want to be blocked, consider adding that number to your contacts. Finally, use keywords with the ‘allow’ setting to prevent certain texts from being blocked. This is useful for verification codes or other text notifications that you might get often from numbers not in your contacts.\nWhat happens to blocked texts? Blocked texts are sent the the Junk folder in the Messages app on your iPhone. You can still view blocked messages there.\nDoes the messages app still work? Yes all your text messages still appear in the messages app. Dont Text is not a messenger app.\nHow do I delete a keyword? To delete a keyword from the block list, swipe the row of the keyword by dragging to the left. The red delete button will appear, press it.\nPrivacy Can you read my text messages? Dont Text only checks text messages from unknown senders. Dont Text cannot access text messages between you and your contacts, or any texts that you send. Dont Text can only check incoming messages from a number not saved in your contacts.\nApple limits the ability of apps from accessing text messages data and therefore, Dont Text cannot read your text messages. Continue reading here for information about Apple’s app limitations.\nWhat data do you store? Texts are checked for containing keywords locally on the device. If you pay for Worry Free Filtering, messages that are not blocked by your keywords are checked by Dont Text for spam. Dont Text can only see the sender’s phone number and message. Dont Text never see’s your phone number or any texts you send.\nDont Text does not save data about you or texts that you send because we do not have access to it in the first place.\nWhat does your App Store app privacy notice mean? Dont Text must verify that users have paid for their subscription to Worry Free Filtering or not. This is done without tracking by using anonymous IDs to verify purchases. Dont Text does not know or store your name or credit card information. No personal information is linked to you.\nDo you have a Privacy Policy and Terms of Service?
